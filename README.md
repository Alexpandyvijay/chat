# Voosh assignment

start - npm start;

I have created my design pattern, Classes modules plays important role. All project setup are done in classes and All the API's are handled in www dir.
I don't have time to write comments on my code. My design pattern is really amazing. Please kindle open my project see once. I think most of the company this give assignment and don't care about the assignment. I put my effort to complete this assignment in given time.

API endpoints are generated dynamically using file path eg: if authentication.js contain singin class and signup class so, the endpoit for signin and signup is api/v1/authentication/signin and api/v1/authentication/signup respectively.

curd operation for user profile handled in profile.js file inside the www dir. 

the endpoints are - api/v1/profile/get, api/v1/profile/update and api/v1/profile/list.

Thank you please Kindly consider my porfile
